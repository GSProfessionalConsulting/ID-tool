# ID-Tool: Instructional Design Course Management System

## Project Overview
A Ruby on Rails 8.0.2 web application for creating and managing instructional design courses with rich content blocks, assessments, and interactive elements.

## Current Status ‚úÖ
- [x] Rails application scaffolded
- [x] Database models created (Course, Lesson, ContentBlock, BlockType)
- [x] Database migrations completed
- [x] Comprehensive seed data created
- [x] RuboCop style violations fixed
- [x] Tests passing (7 tests, 7 assertions, 0 failures)
- [x] Git repository set up and synced with GitHub
- [x] CI/CD pipeline configured
- [x] **Security-focused URL structure implemented** (Sep 10, 2025):
  - `/designer/courses` - For instructional designers (full CRUD access)
  - `/learn/course/:id` - For learners (view-only, single URL navigation)  
  - `/course/:id` - For public sharing (no auth required)
- [x] **All controllers built** (Designer::CoursesController, LearnController, PublicController, HomeController)
- [x] **Basic view templates** for core functionality
- [x] **Rails master key secured** (properly added to .gitignore)

## üõå NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
**Ready to tackle when you return:**

1. **üß™ Test the application** - Start Rails server (`rails server`) and validate all URL routes work
2. **üîê Add user authentication** - Implement Devise gem for login/signup functionality  
3. **üìù Build detailed forms** - Course creation, lesson editing, content block management interfaces
4. **üé® Enhance styling** - Professional UI with Tailwind CSS components and improved UX
5. **üë§ Add user permissions** - Ensure designers only see their own courses (current_user scoping)
6. **üìä Implement course publishing** - Draft ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Published workflow with proper state management

**Current state: All infrastructure complete, ready for user-facing features! üöÄ**

## üîß FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
**Technical debt to address later:**

- **üîÑ Single source of truth for Ruby version** - Currently using both `mise.toml` and `.ruby-version`. Should implement proper mise integration in CI to eliminate duplication and ensure version consistency between local development and CI environments.

## Architecture

### Models
- **Course**: Main course entity with status management (draft/published/archived)
- **Lesson**: Individual lessons within courses with positioning
- **ContentBlock**: Rich content blocks for lessons (text, media, interactive, assessment)
- **BlockType**: Configuration schemas for different content types

### Database Schema
```sql
courses: id, title, description, status, created_at, updated_at
lessons: id, course_id, title, lesson_type, position, created_at, updated_at
content_blocks: id, lesson_id, block_type, position, content (JSON), created_at, updated_at
block_types: id, name, description, config_schema, created_at, updated_at
```
